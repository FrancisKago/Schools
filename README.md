# Schools

This repository contains the **Education Management System** module for Odoo 17. It provides models and views for managing students, courses, exams and additional school activities.

## Running with Docker Compose

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to quickly start Odoo with a Postgres database and load this module. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed, then run:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

After the containers start, access Odoo at [http://localhost:8069](http://localhost:8069). The database uses the default credentials (`odoo` / `odoo`).
